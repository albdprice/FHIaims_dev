These tools were written by Jan Kloppenburg in 2014, jan.kloppenburg@duke.edu

     WARNING:

These files are very specialized to a specific structure of the input data needed.
You CANNOT use then out-of-the-box with your data unsless you have used the 
provided scripts to produce it.

The files in here are:

1x1_clean_geometry:
    The clean slab geometry, YOU have to supply the right one for your purpose.

1x1_clean_energy:
    The total energy of the clean geometry specified in the file above.
    YOU have to supply the correct one for your geometry as well.
    For now these 1x1 files contain energies for the H-terminated SiC slab.

start_all: 
    bash script to create directories, copy files and queue jobs
    YOU must modify this script AND the job_script for the cluser you submit on

start_search: 
    This bash script executes the actual computations

gen_geo.py:
    This MUST be run with python3. Generates random geometries. The underlying slab geometry
    is currently hard coded into this file to MAKE SURE you know WHAT YOU ARE DOING. It is also
    possible to define specific heights in a layer kind of way so the random coordinates don't
    scatter all over the place. If this is what you want remove the routines.
    YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND what is HAPPENING in this file to get meaningful results.
    This file will be copied by start_all bash script into created lower directories.

control.in: 
    MUST be MODIFIED an provided in the same directory as start_all
    This will be copied and is the input for every sinlge run.

For the data analysis after the runs are complete:

make_geometries:
    This bash script generates the neccessary files for the python
    analyzing tool. Its fairly simple. MUST be run in the TOP directory
    of the random search, the directory where the start_all was run in. It is
    not needed to copy this file there, just cd into the appropriate directory
    and then run the script.

geometry_determination.py:
    This MUST be run with python3. There are also other tools needed to run this as intended,
    in particular BRLCAD. It is a free GPL licensed ray tracer and rendering package used to
    render an image of the lowest geometry configuration found which then is made transparent and
    added into the bin-plot. The tools 'convert' from linux distros is also needed there. If you 
    do not whish to use this feature, feel free to comment those lines.
    THIS IS MADE DELIBERATELY so you CANNOT use these tools WITHOUT at least looking through them
    to get an idea of what is going on.
    Once you get this script working, it will produce files called:
      1) dots.png
         This contains a plot of all found (converged) energies with highlights.
      2) bins.png
         This contains a plot of all geometries that are deemed similar and are sorted then into energy bins.
      3) phase.png
         This is the phase diagram with 2 phases of SiC (2x2+1Si and 3x3+13Si) structures as reference computed
         in light and tight settings as well as the lowest found structure from the random search data.
    Example pictures are included and for the phase diagram there are also 3 smaller pngs needed, which are included
    as well or which can be omitted by again commenting the appropriate lines in this script.
