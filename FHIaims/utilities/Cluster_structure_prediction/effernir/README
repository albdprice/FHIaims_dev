To do a basin hoppin calculation, you need the effernir binary and the script bh_optimization.pl, 
which you have to modify for your need a little bit (you find it in the effernir source directory) 
and finally an aims binary.
The control.in.opt file controls effernir, I attached an example with some short information.
Different than in the perl script explained, the effernir control file's name is control.in.opt
