Sketch of aims documentation, VB / FH, 6/12/07

1. Preface

2. Running FHI-aims: quick overview

  2.1 Building aims / Makefile / compilers (appendix) ...

  2.2 Overview of input files

      control.in, geometry.in: General structure

      optional input files

  2.3 Overview of output files

      Order of output stream:
        Repeat control, geometry input
        Info on scf cycles / flow
        Info on relaxation

      How to grep for key terms / what is grep

      Flagging of warnings

      IT IS WORTH READING THE OUTPUT


  2.4 Examples:

    1) Cluster testcase:  H2O dimer, PBE (including relaxation)

    2) Periodic testcase: Au chain, LDA vs. PBE (relax unit cell by hand)  [check what
       happens with PBE as well, just to make sure ... ]

    (quick explanation of progress and results - detailed explanation of
     control.in / geometry.in settings in separate appendix)
