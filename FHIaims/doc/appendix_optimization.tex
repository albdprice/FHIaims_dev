\chapter{Optimizing aims runs (memory, speed) for different computational environments}

\label{appendix_optimization}

   Linking to ScaLapack vs standard Lapack / BLAS

   Single CPU, memory constraints

   Parallelism, lots of memory, good communication (several CPUs with shared
   memory in a single node, e.g. multicore desktop, Power5 shared nodes)

   Parallelism, lots of memory, distributed architecture (slow communication)

   Parallelism, restricted memory, good communication
