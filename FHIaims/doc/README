You have reached the official FHI-aims documentation. The manual of FHI-aims is
written in LaTeX. You need a TeX installation to create a PDF version of the
manual from the TeX source files. TeX distributions may be downloaded free of
charge from e.g.

http://www.latex-project.org
http://www.tug.org

and many other places. Once you have TeX installed, simply type

"make FHI-aims.pdf"

to compile the manual.
