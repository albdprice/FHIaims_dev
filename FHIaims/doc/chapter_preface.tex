The FHI-aims (``Ab Initio Molecular Simulations'') computer code allows to
describe, from quantum-mechanical first principles, the chemical bond and
therefore the properties of any conceivable material (molecules,
solids, surfaces, ...). FHI-aims is an implementation from scratch; it is
based on numeric atom-centered orbitals as all-electron basis functions, and
features density functional theory (DFT) as its primary method for total
energy calculations. However, from the beginning it was our goal to enable
access and functionality \emph{beyond} the bounds of today's highly successful
``standard DFT'', and such functionality is maturing rapidly within FHI-aims
(hybrid functionals, quantum-chemical MP2 perturbation theory,
single-quasiparticle corrections for excited electronic states, based on
many-body perturbation theory in the $GW$ and MP2 approximations). 

From its beginnings less than four years ago, FHI-aims has now matured into
quite a capable electronic structure package that handles many standard tasks
of electronic structure theory (total energy computation at different levels,
relaxation, ...) competitively well. It shines at some specific tasks that
have seen special attention, for example we are somewhat proud of its
performance for large-scale systems on massively parallel computer
architectures. Other areas are subject to ongoing work, and thus we hope the
code will continue to improve and broaden in the future. 

FHI-aims would not be possible without the initiative and
contributions from numerous contributors. When using FHI-aims, we ask
to give credit by citing at least the following reference:

(some of which concerns special developments to be covered separately
from the above publication), simply in alphabetical order:
