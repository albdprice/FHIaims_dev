Update of really tight default basis set choice, i.e., some radial
functions added to or removed from the default uncommented basis
sets. With the exception of Ba, no other changes made to the
defaults. 

The reason for this change is our experience with the "Delta test" as
well as to make some changes across elements more consistent with
other groups. The result should be a set of species defaults that is
somewhat more tightly converged than the original "tight" and
"really_tight" defaults. 

If successful, the amended choice of radial functions will also
extended back to the existing "tight" defaults.

For LDA/GGA, the associated increase in computational cost is
manageable. For hybrid functionals, the balance is different, however,
as here the computational cost scales with N^4 where N is the number
of basis functions *per atom* (not the total number). The basis
functions per atom all occupy the same space and thus, for these we
cannot obtain O(N) scaling either for time or for memory demand.

The existing "tight" settings are already demanding for hybrid
functionals and need to be retained for the future, at least for this
case.
