This directory contains a small set of regression tests along with reference
output.

The regression tests are within the subdirectories and can be run using

  ./regression.py run /path/to/aimsbinary

You may then compare the results to the old reference files using

  ./regression.py diff /path/to/aimsbinary

With --differ <differ> you may use another visual diff programm of your choice
(meld, kdiff3, kompare, ...).  You can even compare to an old run as long as
the output names differ using

  ./regression.py diff /path/to/aimsbinary --refstem yyyyyy

See "./regression.py --help" for help -- there are some quite useful
additional options.  Please note that the resulting files (and possibly
directories) are compared with the ./numdiff.py script to ignore tiny
numerical differences and execution times.  You can fine-tune its behavior by
either calling it directly or passing options with "-O" to ./regression.py.
