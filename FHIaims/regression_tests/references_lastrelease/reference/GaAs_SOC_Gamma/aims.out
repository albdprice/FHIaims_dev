  ** Accordingly, the SOC code will temporarily convert from ScaLAPACK (currently used) to LAPACK
  ** and will revert back to ScaLAPACK at the end of this calculation.
  ** For large systems, you will run into memory issues!

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -115059.186023369 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -115059.186023369 eV
  | Total energy after non-SC SOC correction (DO NOT USE)          :        -115059.262796441 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -13.922822026 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

 * A warning was issued further up regarding the accuracy of onsite integrals.
   An integral with a negative eigenvalue was among the flagged integrals.
   In most standard situations, this warning is probably harmless.
   If needed, this can be verified by adjusting the radial_multiplier flag.

          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:        6.810 MB (on task 0 after allocating potential_shell)
          |   Maximum:        7.062 MB (on task 3 after allocating potential_shell)
          |   Average:        6.886 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        2.079 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 0)
          |   Maximum:        2.283 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 3)
          |   Average:        2.144 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
