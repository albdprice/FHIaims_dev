 * Warning! You are trying to treat an element beyond Ca (Z=20) without
 * accounting for relativity. This may lead to physically incorrect results.
 * If you know what you are doing, you may override this warning using the
 * flag override_relativity in control.in.
 * Else, please use the keyword 'relativistic atomic_zora scalar' (for relaxation) or
 * 'relativistic zora scalar 1e-12' as described in the documentation.
 *
 * Additional information about a change made 04/05/2010 (will be removed 2011):
 * Since there is no harm in using atomic_zora, we now mandate relativity also
 * for the 3d elements. Apologies to all those whom this affects for the first time.
 * Of course, any older nonrelativistic total energies for these elements must never
 * be compared (added or subtracted) directly to atomic_zora results.
