This test case produces a partial band structure and the DOS
of bulk Si in LDA and with light settings, as described in
the manual.

To see it work, simply run FHI-aims with the given input
files. Once the code is done, simply run the aimsplot.py
script from the "utilities" directory to obtain a plot
of the band structure and DOS.

Three things: 

1) You may wish to compare the result to the more accurate 
   "tight" settings for Si. This takes significantly longer
   (as the name suggests, everything is more "tight"), but
   for production purposes, it is a good idea to check.

2) The DOS broadening and DOS k_grid factors used here give
   a nice-loking DOS. To save time, one could set the 
   broadening to 0.1 eV and the k_grid factors to "5 5 5".
   This also yields a smooth-looking DOS, although a bit more
   washed out. In general, if you obtain a "wiggly" DOS,
   tightening the k-grid factors is a good idea.

3) The "aimsplot.py" script requires python's matplotlib to 
   function fully.
