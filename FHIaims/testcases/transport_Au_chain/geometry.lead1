# Geometry for the lead number 1 to be used for calculating the lead. 
# The semi-infinte lead points
# to the direction of negative x-axis and the device is to the
# direction of positive x-axis after the last lead atom (see geometry
# file for the system). The transport direction of the lead is
# always given by the third lattice vector that points into the
# semi-infinite lead.
