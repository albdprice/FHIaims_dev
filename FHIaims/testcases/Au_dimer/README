Simple testcase to illustrate the intended handling of structure relaxation
etc. for scalar-relativistic calculations in FHI-aims: Relaxation of the gold
dimer, Au_2.

Note that steps 1 and 2, i.e., the "atomic_zora" method, is the
recommended method at this point (following the "Delta project",
https://molmod.ugent.be/deltacodesdft). 

The exchange-correlation choice is pw_lda, and all calculations are
non-spinpolarized. Spin-orbit coupling is included into the energy
levels non-selfconsistently after the second step.


Step 1: ./relax_light/

        Choose a starting geometry (3.0 AA in this case) and set up a fast
        control.in file using the "light" species defaults for Au. 

        The "relativistic" setting is atomic_zora. 

Step 2: ./postrelax_tight/

        The final geometry of step 1 (from the standard output or from the file
        geometry.in.next_step) is used as the starting point for a more
        accurate post-relaxation, this
        time using the "tight" species_defaults for Au. Spin-orbit
        coupling is included. Note that this corrects ONLY the
        Kohn-Sham eigenvalues. For the total energy, only the scalar
        relativistic total energy should be trusted.

This testcase used to include an example of scaled ZORA, but, as
outlined in the manual, multiple tests convinced us that scaled ZORA
adds no discernible value. Just use atomic ZORA plus (optionally)
spin-orbit coupling for production.
