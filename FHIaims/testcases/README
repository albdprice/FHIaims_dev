The FHI-aims "testcases" directory is intended to house only a select few,
narrow testcases that should be tried out by new users to make sure that their
code version works and produces the exact same results as shown here. 

We can add new testcases over time, but those do not serve the same purpose as
the regression tests. Regression tests should be more exhaustive, as they
also serve to check functionality which is experimental, or whose development
has been temporarily halted but may be picked up again in the future. 

Please ask if you have a good, educational test case of general value that you
think should be added to the testcases directory.
