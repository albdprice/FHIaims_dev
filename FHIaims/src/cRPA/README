This code is an experimental real-space implementation of periodic RPA. 
The files are unused since the development of this functionality is 
temporarily suspended due to the currently higher priority of other
related developments. At the moment, certain unusual Fortran constructs 
in this code keep causing issues with compilers that are not the latest ones. 
However, we keep the files in the git repository since we plan to continue 
the development when its priority is restored in due time.
