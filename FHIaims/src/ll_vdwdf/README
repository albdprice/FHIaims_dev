The subdirectory ll_vdwdf contains the kernel data needed to evaluate the
Langreth-Lundqvist nonlocal ("van der Waals") density functional by a Monte
Carlo integration technique. 

- kernel_my.dat : 
  Mina Yoon's ("MY") current version of the "kernel.dat" file mentioned in the
  documentation. When using FHI-aims with the ll_vdwdf functionality, this
  file must be referenced in your control.in file (see documentation), and it
  must be located in (copied to!) your working directory. 

- control_llvdwdf.in : 
  An example of a control file that should work for
  ll_vdwdf for Ar. PLEASE NOTE that this file may have to be modified for your
  own purposes according to the manual. Use it as an example, but also check
  that the species_defaults you are using are actually current (possibly
  different from the species_default data present in this file) etc.
