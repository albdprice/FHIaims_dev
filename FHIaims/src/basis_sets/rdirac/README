Subdirectory external/lesser_gpl is meant to contain code that is linked to by
FHI-aims, and that is originally distributed by its original authors under the
terms of the Lesser General Public License (see the COPYING file). 

In principle, this code could also be downloaded from the original authors and
just linked to by FHI-aims - we here choose to provide the code for a direct
compilation with the rest of the FHI-aims for simplicity. Of course, the
original LGPL applies to all the code in this subdirectory, including for
any possible modifications made by us. Since FHI-aims comes with all the
source code, any relevant modifications are (obviously) also included as
source, anyway.

In any case - we believe that using and providing the code in this way agrees
with the license, importantly also with the spirit of the license, and thus
with the original authors' intent. For anyone adding external code to this
subdirectory, please keep it that way.
