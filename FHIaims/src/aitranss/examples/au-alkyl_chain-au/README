 This example serves to output a ballistic transmission function of the
 molecular junction comprising an alkyl-wire linked to Au electrodes.

 HOW RESULTS HAVE BEEN GENERATED:

 (i)   control.in file (with a line "output aitranss") & geometry.in 
       files have been used for the FHI-aims run. Output of FHI-aims has 
       been redirected to a file "aims.dft.out".

       After a job has been executed, files "omat.aims", "mos.aims"
       and "basis-indices.out" have been written to the current 
       directrory by FHI-aims (because of large size, these files are
       not present in the directory).

 (ii)  A script "tcontrol.aims.x" has been exploited as

       tcontrol.aims.x -lsurc 40 -lsurx 39 -lsury 35 -rsurc 38 -rsurx 37 -rsury 33 -nlayers 2 -ener -0.4000 -estep 0.0001 -eend 0.0000

       to create a mandatory file "tcontrol" for the "aitranss" module

 (iii) "aitranss" module ("aitranss.x") has been executed with an output 
       redirected to a file "aitranss.out". After calculation is finished, 
       ballistic transmission function is found in a file "TE.dat".

 (iv)  A 'gnuplot' (with a line: plot 'TE.dat' u 2:3 w l) has been used
       to visualize results and generate a postscript file "TE.ps"
