 The "aitranss" (ab initio transport simulations) package is a project
 under continuous development at the Institute of Nanotechnology of the
 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, since 2002. In brief, 
 when combined with FHI-aims, "aitranss" provides a post-processor
 module that enables, e.g., calculation of the electron transport
 characteristics of molecular junctions based on a Landauer formalism 
 in a (non-equilibrium) Green's function formulation.

 Current version of the "aitranss" module, available to FHI-aims users, is
 limited to computation of the ballistic Landauer-Buettiker transmission
 function and local density of states projected on atoms.

 This file contains a brief overview of the included material, and
 few remarks on how to compile and use the module. For further details,
 we encourage interested users to refer to a corresponding chapter in
 the FHI-aims manual.

 For question and bug reports, please contact: Alexej.Bagrets <at> kit.edu

 OVERVIEW OF THE INCLUDED MATERIAL: 
 ----------------------------------

 subdirectory ./source : contains a Fortran 90 code and the draft
                         Makefile. A mandatory prerequisite to build the
                         code is a Fortran90/95 capable compiler and a
                         compiled version of LAPACK and BLAS (for example,
                         Intel's MKL). Please, use an included example
                         of the Makefile and adjust variables FC, LD,
                         FLAGS and LIBS appropriately.

                         A binary ("aitranss.x") built by the Makefile
                         will go to the ./bin directory of the FHI-aims.

                         Current release of the transport code, in
                         contrast to FHI-aims, is not yet based on MPI.
                         However, you are encouraged to use a fortran
                         compiler's option(s), aka "-openmp" and "-O2"
                         for Intel's ifort, to build a multithreaded
                         code based on OpenMP directives.

			 According to our experience, a generated code
			 can be safety executed in parallel within a
			 single compute node with multiple processors,
			 and with a significant gain in computation time.

 subdirectory ./tcontrol.script :

			 contains a script "tcontrol.aims.x" which
			 is served to prepare a mandatory input file
			 "tcontrol" for the "aitranss" module

			 Please, refer to the FHI-aims documentation on
			 how to use this script. You may also wish to
			 copy a "tcontrol.aims.x" to your ~/bin directory
			 to make it generally available. For a short
			 description, type: "tcontrol.aims.x --help"

 subdirectory ./electrodes.library :

			 contains a library of representative Au clusters,
			 which should be linked to your molecular
			 system to create an "extended molecule":
			 its electronic structure (Kohn-Sham molecular
			 orbitals and energies) is a prerequisite to
			 compute transport characteristics.

			 Each included library file contains a mandatory
			 argument to be used with the "tcontrol.aims.x"
			 script.

 subdirectory ./examples : contains two examples, with input and output
			 files of the FHI-aims and "aitranss" module.
			 Examples are: (i) Au-benzene-dithiol-Au junction, 
			 and (ii) Au-alkyl_chain-Au molecular junction. 
			 Please, look also into local README files, for 
			 short guidelines on how to run a particular 
			 transport calculation.


 BRIEF COMMENTS ON USAGE: 
 ------------------------

 (i)   Having your favorite molecule at hands, link it via anchoring
       groups to metallic Au clusters (found in ./electrodes.library
       subdirectory) and create an "extended molecule".

 (ii)  Run the FHI-aims exploiting a "cluster" type (non-periodic)
       calculation (no k-points). Your "control.in" file should contain
       a line :

       output aitranss

       After FHI-aims run, you'll find in your directory following
       files: 
       
       -- "basis.indices.out" (compressed information on basis functions) 
       -- "omat.aims" (overlap integrals) 
       -- "mos.aims"  (Kohn-Sham molecular orbitals and energies) 
       
       If spin channels of your system are not identical, corresponding 
       files will be called "alpha.aims" and "beta.aims"

 (iii) Use a "tcontrol.aims.x" script with options and arguments described
       in the FHI-aims manual, and create a mandatory file "tcontrol"
       to enable transport calculation.

 (iv)  Use a binary file "aitranss.x" to run a post-processor transport
       calculation after FHI-aims.

       The FHI-aims output files ("basis.indices.out", "omat.aims",
       "mos.aims" or "alpha.aims" & "beta.aims") together with information
       provided from files "tcontrol" and "geometry.in" will be used by
       transport code to reconstruct a Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian (H) of the
       "extended molecule", to supplement H with the self-energy, and to
       compute a ballistic (Landauer-Buettiker) transmission function,
       exploiting Green's function formalism.

 and happy electron transport calculations with "aitranss" & FHI-aims!
