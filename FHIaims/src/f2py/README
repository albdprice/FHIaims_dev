This directory contains some utilities to use f2py on FHI-aims subroutines in
order to test and inspect them.  To use them, at least python and numpy must
be installed, some visualization is done using scipy and matplotlib.

In the Makefile, some examples are shown with automatically generated .pyf
interface files.  For most applications, hand-written or hand-tuned interface
files will be needed, though, because of quite some F90 features which are not
supported by f2py.  Some of them are automatically handled in the Makefile,
though.
