This directory contains files related to the use of the `dfauto` script in FHI-aims. The `dfauto` script is capable of autogenerating Fortran code for the evaluation of a density functional and its potential given a definition in Maple.

The functional definitions are provided in the files `*.df`, the autogenerated code is distributed with FHI-aims in the file `xc_func.f`, based off of the template in `xc_func.template.f`. The `dfauto` script is not distributed with FHI-aims, but can be freely downloaded from the [CPC Library](http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADNY_v1_0.html) and is documented in an accompanying [manuscript](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-4655(01)00148-5).

The Fortran code can be regenerated by running `make rebuild`, which requires an installed Maple instance. The code has been tested with Maple 16. The functionals are autodocumented in `doc.pdf`, which has been created with `make doc`.

Since Maple is a non-trivial dependency, the autogenerated code is committed to the FHI-aims repository. If you add or modify the functional definitions, commit also the rebuilt Fortran code as well as the functional documentation in the PDF format.
