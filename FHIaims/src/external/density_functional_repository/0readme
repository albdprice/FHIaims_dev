Preface

This database contains a collection of subroutines coding density functionals for use in electronic structure programs. Besides each subroutine the results of a set of test calculations employing that routine are provided. These reference data are purely meant to assist in porting the functionals to electronic structure programs. With this purpose in mind the test calculations have been designed to be as reproducible as possible.

The considerations that led to the current design are stored for reference. It is advised to read this document as it describes the calling conventions as well.

Acknowledgements

A number of people have contributed to this repository in various ways. Without their contributions maintaining a repository of this nature would be impossible.

First of all I would like to thank Fred Manby and Peter Knowles for providing me with the dfauto program [Strange:2001]. Without this essential piece of machinery it would have been impossible to generate all the second derivatives of the functionals in a sensible amount of time.

I would like to thank Nicholas Handy for providing me with the source code of the HCTH, B97 and B97-1 functionals.

I would like to thank John Perdew and Matt Challacombe for providing implementations of the PBE functional.

Thanks also to Michael Filatov and Walter Thiel for providing implementation of the FT97 functionals.
