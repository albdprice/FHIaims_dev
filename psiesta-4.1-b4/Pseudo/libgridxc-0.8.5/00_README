GridXC library

This directory contains, as a self-contained package, the source code
of the GridXC library, originally (as SiestaXC) part of the SIESTA
distribution. SiestaXC was coded by Jose Soler. The library is now
maintained by Alberto Garcia.

GridXC provides routines to calculate the exchange and correlation
energy and potential in spherical (i.e. an atom) or periodic systems,
using a variety of LDA and GGA functionals, as well as the van der
Waals DFT functionals of Dion et al (PRL 92, 246401 (2004)), Lee et al
(PRB 82, 081101 (2010)), Klimes et al (JPCM 22, 022201 (2009)), and
Vydrov and VanVoorhis (JCP 133, 244103 (2010)) implemented as
described by Roman-Perez and Soler (PRL 103, 096102 (2009))

An interface to the Libxc library is also available.

See src/gridxc.F90 for how to call the GridXC library routines

See INSTALL for compilation instructions.
