See UserGuide.pdf for a tutorial and a reference to the 
SAX and stream XPATH parser APIs.

The sax and xpath directories contain the source for the exercises in
the User Guide.

The DOM interface is documented in DOM.md (in Markdown format) and
html/DOM.html (directly readable in a web browser).

The WXML writing library and the "Jumbo90" (CML writer by Jon Wakelin)
are documented altogether in WXML.md, as well as separately in
html/WXML.html, html/jumbo.html and html/jumbodocs.html.

A brief introduction to the library and its underlying concepts can be
found in Overview.md.
