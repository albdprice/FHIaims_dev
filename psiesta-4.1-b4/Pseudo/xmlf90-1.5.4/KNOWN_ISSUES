KNOWN ISSUES as of version 1.5

* It accepts only single-byte encodings for characters. 

* Currently, there are hard-wired limits on the length of element
  and attribute identifiers, and the length of attribute values and
  unbroken (i.e., without whitespace) PCDATA sections.  The limit is
  set in sax/m_buffer.f90 to MAX_BUFF_SIZE=1024.

* Overly long comments and SGML declarations can also be truncated,
  but the effect is currently harmless since the parser does not make
  use of that information. In a future version there could be a more
  robust retrieval mechanism.

* The number of attributes is limited to MAX_ITEMS=64
  in sax/m_dictionary.f90.

* In the XPATH interface, returned PCDATA character buffers cannot be
  larger than an internal size of MAX_PCDATA_SIZE=65536 set in
  xpath/m_path.f90.

* The XPATH API is not solid yet, particularly in the area of contexts
  handling.  A new one could be defined using the DOM module, but, not
  being stream-oriented, it will loose its small memory footprint and
  speed.
